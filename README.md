# ü™ê spaCy Project: CryptoNER

A Named Entity Recognition model for cryptocurrencies. The model is trained on comments and posts collected from the [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/) subreddit. The data is annotated using [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/) and the output encoded as a `.json` file.

## üìã project.yml

The [`project.yml`](project.yml) file defines the data assets required by the
project, as well as the available commands and workflows. For details, see the
[spaCy projects documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/projects).

### ‚èØ Commands

The following commands are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [command_name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run).
Commands are only re-run if their inputs have changed.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **`preprocess`** | Unzip, convert and split Label Studio annotated data into `train.spacy`, `test.spacy` and `dev.spacy` |
| **`debug`** | Debug spaCy‚Äôs config file and binary training data |
| **`train`** | Train the model |
| **`evaluate`** | Evaluate the best model on `test.spacy` and generate a displacy visualization |

### ‚è≠ Workflows

The following workflows are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [workflow_name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run)
and will run the specified commands in order. Commands are only re-run if their
inputs have changed.

| Workflow | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| `all` | `preprocess` &rarr; `debug` &rarr; `train` &rarr; `evaluate` |
